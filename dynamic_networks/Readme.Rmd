## What will you find in this directory?

Here are all the scripts for creating "dynamic" networks. By "dynamic", we mean to create several networks for small time windows and move these windows year by year. In other words, we are creating networks for 1969-1973, 1970-1974, 1971-1975, until 2011-2015. We then identify communities that are persisting over time, and give them names.

This directory contains:

### Script_paths_and_basic_objects

As in other directories, a [Script_paths_and_basic_objects.R](/dynamic_networks/Script_paths_and_basic_objects.R) with all the packages needed in the directory, and essential path and data. This script is loaded in other scripts;

### 1_building_dynamic_networks

The [script 1_building_dynamic_networks](/dynamic_networks/1_building_dynamic_networks.md) that creates all the networks for each window, then find communities and calculates coordinates. All the networks are fill in a list, and the list is saved. The script also saves separately all the nodes and edges in a long format;

### 2_building_dynamic_communities

The [script 2_building_dynamic_communities](/dynamic_networks/2_building_dynamic_communities.md) takes as an input the list of networks saved in the previous script. The script implements a procedure to find communities that are persisting over time. Basically, for each community in two close networks (for instance 1973-1977 and 1974-1978), it looks how many nodes existing in both networks (that is articles published between 1974 and 1977) are in each community. If a community A from 1973-1977 has a high percentage of nodes going in community B from 1974-1978, and if a large proportion of nodes in community B comes from A, thus we consider A and B as the same community. The output is a data frame with all the nodes of the corpus, and their respective communities for each time window.

### 3_introducing_communities_names

The [script 3_introducing_communities_names](/dynamic_networks/3_introducing_communities_names.md) that takes as an input the list of nodes and their communities saved in the former script, and introduces the names of the communities. These names have been created by a qualitative assessment of the characteristics of each community.

### naming_communities

The Rmarkdown file ["naming_communities"](/dynamic_networks/naming_communities.Rmd) which produces an html document with the main characteristics of all the communities identified in [2_building_dynamic_communities](/dynamic_networks/2_building_dynamic_communities.md). This document will help to name communities qualitatively. 

### testing_threshold_for_building_networks

The Rmarkdown file ["testing_threshold_for_building_networks"](/dynamic_networks/testing_threshold_for_building_networks.Rmd) which runs some tests on the effects of the different thresholds implemented in [1_building_dynamic_networks](/dynamic_networks/1_building_dynamic_networks.md).
