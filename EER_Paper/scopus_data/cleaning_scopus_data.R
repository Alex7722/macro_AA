#' # What is this script for?
#' 
#' This script aims at cleaning scopus data. The input is a .txt with articles metadata and their references
#' extracted from scopus. It aims at producing a data.frame that we will merge with WoS data.

#' # Cleaning scopus data

#' ## Cleaning the .txt file
#' We need first to extract the relevant lines to put them in a data frame (authors, id, affiliations, title, journal, etc...). We also needs to save the references 
#' for each article in a list object. At the end of this part, we will have a list of the articles from the missing years, and a direct citation
#' data frame with all the references cited by the articles.
#' 
#' ### removing useless lines.
#' 
#' This step is not absolutely necessary, but it helps us to have a cleaner text, and to focus on the relevant information

#' ### identifying the relevant information to put them in a data frame
#' 
#' This data frame will be the list of our scopus articles for the four missing years.
#' 
#' #### Identifying ids
scopus$id <- str_detect(scopus$Scopus, pattern = "^[:digit:]{8,}")

#' #### Identifying authors
name <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) - 1 # this saves the position in the text of authors names (one line above the id)

scopus$author <- FALSE # useful later for affiliations
scopus[name]$author <- TRUE

#' #### identifying title
titre <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) + 1

#' #### Identifying informations on the article (journal, volume, etc.)
info <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) + 2

#' #### Identifying authors's affiliations
#' 
#' The problem here is that some affiliations are on two lines when you have several authors or when
#' one author has several affiliations. N.B.: in the case of several authors, we are unable to 
#' know which affiliation is corresponding to each author.

scopus[aff][author != TRUE & start_ref != TRUE]$affiliation  <- TRUE
aff <- which(scopus$affiliation == TRUE)

# when affiliation is in two lines we merge the two lines (no better method find)

                  use.names = FALSE) # filling missing values with NA

#' #### Creating the data frame of articles

scopus_art <- data.table("temp_id" = 1:length(scopus[id == TRUE]$Scopus),
           "id" = scopus[id == TRUE]$Scopus, 
           "author" = scopus[name]$Scopus,

           "info" = scopus[info]$Scopus,
           "affiliation" = affiliation)


#' ### Identifying references 
#' 
#' This task is a bit harder as they are on several lines. What we do is to 
#' associate each reference of an article to the `temp_id` of the article.  

start_ref <- which(scopus$start_ref == TRUE)
end_ref <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) - 2 # identifying the last line of the references (two lines above the id)
end_ref <- c(end_ref[-1], length(scopus$Scopus)) # removing the first value which is logically 0 (for the first article) and adding the last line of the text which is the last reference of the last article

#' We delete each line which corresponds to an article without references. Indeed, we have a `end_ref` value, but no `start_ref`
#' as there is no reference in this article. We also do it for the names, as it will be needed later to match each set of references
#' with their corresponding article.

for(i in 1:1000){
  name <- name[-min(which(start_ref > end_ref))]
  end_ref <- end_ref[-min(which(start_ref > end_ref))]
  
  if(length((which(start_ref > end_ref))) == 0){
    break
  }
}

#' We create the data table which associates each `temp_id` of articles with at least one reference, to the references they cite. 
#' That is a direct citation data frame that we now need to clean.
scopus_ref  <- data.table("temp_id" = c(),
                          "references" = c())

#' ## Cleaning the corpus
#' 
#' We first tackle the data table with the list of articles. WE need to clean the id,
#' giving names corresponding to the WoS format (SURNAME-F), creating as many lines as author,
#' cleaning journal and volume info, as well as affiliations.
#' 

#' ### Cleaning `id`
#' 
#' We only keep the first id, before the first semicolon

scopus_art  <- scopus_art[, id:= str_replace(id, pattern = ";.*", "")]

#' ### Cleaning `author`
#' 
#' We need to separate surnames and initials for each authors.
#' 
#' The first step is to calculate the maximum number of authors for an article. We use the number
#' of comma in a row to calculate this (one comma, separating surname and initial means 1 author,
#' 3 commas mean 2 authors, etc.). Then we can create the different columns to put the surnames 
#' and initials in.

nb_authors <- max((str_count(scopus_art$author, ",") + 1)/2)
name_column <- paste0(c("surname_","initial_"),rep(1:nb_authors, each = 2))

scopus_art  <- scopus_art %>% 
separate(author, name_column, ",")

#' We want to avoid NA initials and we want to clean this as soon as possible, thus we check if we have 
#' missing values

test  <-  scopus_art %>% 
  filter(!is.na(surname_1) & is.na(initial_1)) %>% 
  select(surname_1)
if(length(test$surname_1) > 0){
  message("Missing values for initials")
} else {
    message("No missing values for initials")
  }

scopus_art %>% 
  filter(!is.na(surname_2) & is.na(initial_2)) %>% 
  select(surname_2)
if(length(test$surname_2) > 0){
  message("Missing values for initials")
} else {
  message("No missing values for initials")
}

#' we now want to create authors column like in WoS
# cleaning by removing space, punctuation, and fusioning surnames and initials
scopus_art %<>% 
  mutate(across(contains("surname"), ~ remove_space(.x, replacement = "-")),
         across(contains("initial"), ~ remove_punct(remove_space(.x))),
         across(contains("surname"), ~ str_replace(.x,"^-",""))) %>% 
  .[, `:=` (author_1 = paste0(surname_1,"-",initial_1),
            author_2 = paste0(surname_2,"-",initial_2),
            author_3 = paste0(surname_3,"-",initial_3),
            author_4 = paste0(surname_4,"-",initial_4),
            author_5 = paste0(surname_5,"-",initial_5))] %>% 
  .[, -..name_column]

#' we now wants to have all the authors in one column.

scopus_art %<>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("author"), 
               names_to = c("order"), 
               values_to = "author")  %>% 
  filter(author != "NA-NA") %>% 
  mutate(order = str_extract(order, "[:digit:]")) %>% # just keeping the number in order, giving us the order of authors in the paper (as in WoS)
  as.data.table()

#' we save the list of authors per article in a separate dataframe. In the main dataframe, we will only keep the 
#' rows with the first author. We also keep the affiliations in a separated dataframe
#' 
#' 

scopus_inst <- scopus_art[order == 1][,c("temp_id","affiliation.affiliation")]
scopus_art <- scopus_art[order == 1][, -c("id","order","affiliation.affiliation")]
 
#' ### Cleaning `scopus_art`
#' 
#' We need to put the year, the Review (which is the same in our case), the volume, the number, and the 
#' pages in separated columns, and delete the number of citations.

scopus_art[, `:=` (title = toupper(title), # useful for later
                   Annee_Bibliographique = extract_year(info),
                   Journal = "European Economic Review",
                   info = str_remove(str_remove(info, ".*Review, "), ". Cited .*"))] %>% 
  .[, `:=` (Volume = str_extract(info, "^."),
            Number = str_extract(info, "([:digit:]{1})"),
            Pages = str_remove(str_remove(str_extract(info, "pp.*"), "pp. "), "\\."))] # We first extract the number following pp., then we remove pp. and the final point.

# removing doublons for 1970 (actually they are in WoS)
scopus_art_1970 <- scopus_art[Annee_Bibliographique == 1970]$temp_id
scopus_art <- scopus_art[Annee_Bibliographique != 1970]
#' The `scopus_art` is now clean, and we can save it !
saveRDS(scopus_art[,-"info"], paste0(eer_data,"scopus_articles.RDS"))

#' ### Cleaning `affiliation` (`scopus_inst`)
#' 
#' We first have to separate the rows where there are two affiliations, and put them in a 
#' "long" format. 

affiliation_column <- paste0("affiliation_",1:(max(str_count(scopus_inst$affiliation.affiliation,";"), na.rm = TRUE) + 1))

scopus_inst %<>% 
  rename("affiliation" = affiliation.affiliation) %>% 
  mutate(affiliation = str_remove(affiliation, "AFFILIATIONS: ")) %>% 
  separate(affiliation, all_of(affiliation_column), ";") %>% 
  pivot_longer(all_of(affiliation_column), names_to = "order_inst", values_to = "affiliation") %>% 
  mutate(order_inst = str_remove(order_inst, "affiliation_")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(affiliation))

#' We can now clean the affiliations:
#' 
#' - we first extract the last part, which is in general the country
#' - we clean the country by hand
#' - we split the remaining part, the first one being the institution, the second
#' one the city.
#' 

scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  mutate(country = str_extract(affiliation, ",[a-zA-Z√Ä-√ø-'\\- ]{1,}$") %>% 
           str_remove(",|, ") %>% 
           str_trim("both")) %>% 
  mutate(country = replace(country, country == "Beograd", "Yoguslavia")) # hand cleaning

#' To take into account of missing countries, we delete the last part of affiliation for 
#' affiliations that contain the name of an identified country

           str_trim("right") %>% 
           str_remove(",$")) 

#' We can now tackle the remaining part of the affiliation. We count the number of 
#' commas before to split `affiliation`, in order to create the needed number of columns
#' and then to name properly the column (it should be `institution`,`city`,`state`, the latter
#' being only for the US).
affiliation_column <- paste0("affiliation_",1:(max(str_count(scopus_inst$affiliation,","), na.rm = TRUE) + 1))

scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>%

                      c("temp_id","order_inst","affiliation_2")] # We build the list of cities, adding "The Hague" we did not fit in the criteria above (no space, no point)

#' ## Cleaning the references
#' 
#' We now tackle the direct citation data frame. We need to extract the different information in each references

#' ### Removing the term "REFERENCES"
#' 
scopus_ref[, references:= str_remove(references, "REFERENCES: ")]

#' ### Dealing with several references on line and cleaning
#' 
#' First problem, we sometimes have two references on one line. One way to detect this is to spot the lines
#' where the semi-colon is followed by at least one character. We thus need to split these lines in two and
#' retransforme the table in a long format.

# just to check, detecting if there are two reference on one line
if(length(which(str_detect(scopus_ref$references, ";."))) > 0){
  message("There are lines with two references. Need for splitting.")
}

scopus_ref %<>% 
  separate(references, c("references","ref2"), ";") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("references","ref2"),
               names_to = "order",
               values_to = "references") %>% 
  select(-order) %>% 
  filter(references != "" & !is.na(references))

#' We can now give an idea to each reference
#' 

setDT(scopus_ref)[, temp_idref := 1:.N]

#' We can clean the references by removing first and last space
#' 

scopus_ref[, references := str_trim(references, "both")]

#' A first additional cleaning we can do is to remove the references beginning by a year between brackets. In each case
#' either it is a very particular reference (a European report for instance) or it is the reference where one reference 
#' (the one in the line above) has been reprinted. That is not perfect to remove that but we don't need this information
#' and it will simplify our data and our work.
#' 

scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[!str_detect(scopus_ref$references, "^\\([:digit:]{4}\\)")]

#' Lastly, we correct some things that will cause problems later.
#' 

scopus_ref[, references := str_replace(references, "Kronsjo¬®","Kronsjo")]
scopus_ref[, references := str_remove(references, "et al.,")]

  
#' ### Determining the type of references
#' 
#' We need first to know if a reference is an article (title is before year), or if it
#' is a book or report or similar. 
#' 

scopus_ref[, article := str_detect(references, "^[a-zA-Z√Ä-√ø-'\\- ]{1,}, [a-zA-Z√Ä-√ø-]{1,}")]

#' Article also included chapters of books. Thus, the title will be the title of the chapter
#' and the `Journal` will be the title of the book. Other info on the book will be in `journal_info`
#' (see below).

#' ### Extracting the Year
#' 
#' That is the simplest task as we just need to extract the numbers between brackets. 
#' We will keep it in `references` as it will help us to identify the title. 
#' 
#' We will delete the references without a year. Either they are references to unpublished
#' conference paper, or to not yet published article, or they are the second line in a 
#' reference, which designate where the work (in the line above) has been reprinted. That's
#' a simplification that we can abandon later, but for now, we delete reference with no value
#' as a `Year`.
#' 

scopus_ref[, Year := extract_year(references)]
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[!is.na(Year)]

#' ### Dealing with articles
#' 
#' For articles, we have the name of the authors, sometimes the first name, and the title of the article before the year between
#' brackets. First, we will extract the information before the bracket to put it in a separate column. We extract the year 
#' between brackets to be sure that we don't extract the text before a bracket in the title, and then remove the year and the bracket.
#' 

scopus_ref[article == TRUE, 
           article_info := str_remove(str_extract(references, ".*\\([:digit:]{4}\\)"),
                                      "\\([:digit:]{4}\\)")]

#' The second step is to try to identify when you have the first name of an author, or several authors.
#' 

# Extracting first author and removing it from article_info
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, `:=` (author_1 = str_remove(str_extract(article_info, "^[a-zA-Z√Ä-√ø-'\\- ]{2,},"), ","), # we need special characters and space (for two parts name)
                                  article_info = str_remove(article_info, "^[a-zA-Z√Ä-√ø-]{2,},"))]

# Then we count the number of commas on the remaining article info
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, comma_count := str_count(article_info, ",")]

# if 0 comma, it means we have the title of article
article_title <- scopus_ref[article == TRUE & comma_count == 0, c("temp_idref","article_info")] 
setnames(article_title, "article_info", "article_title")
scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, article_title, by = "temp_idref", all.x = TRUE)

#' We can now split every article info with at least one comma. We create the number 
#' of columns corresponding to the number of splits (3 commas mean 4 splits). Then, we 
#' create a new object with the splitted information, in order to identify if each splits is
#' an author or a part of the title.
#' 
#' > warning: this is not an automatic step. It implies to look at the `article_info_1` column
#' and check if our code is able to separate authors from part of the titles. It involves a bit
#' of manual cleaning, by removing some word from authors-selection, or by adding some names 
#' (de la Vall√©e Poussin here).

info_title <- paste0("article_info_", 1:(max(scopus_ref$comma_count, na.rm = TRUE)+1)) 

working_title <- scopus_ref %>%
