# 1 What is this script for?

This script aims at cleaning scopus data. The input is a .txt with
articles metadata and their references extracted from scopus. It aims at
producing a data.frame that we will merge with WoS data.

# 2 Loading packages, paths and data

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
eer_data <- "/projects/data/macro_AA/EER/Corpus_EER/"
source("~/macro_AA/functions/functions_for_cleaning_strings.R")
```

We import the list of articles extracted from SCOPUS

``` r
scopus <- read_delim(paste0(eer_data,"EER_scopus.txt"), "\t", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE) %>% data.table()
```

# 3 Cleaning scopus data

## 3.1 Cleaning the .txt file

We need first to extract the relevant lines to put them in a data frame
(authors, id, affiliations, title, journal, etc…). We also needs to save
the references for each article in a list object. At the end of this
part, we will have a list of the articles from the missing years, and a
direct citation data frame with all the references cited by the
articles.

### 3.1.1 removing useless lines.

This step is not absolutely necessary, but it helps us to have a cleaner
text, and to focus on the relevant information

``` r
remove_lines <- c("ISSN",
                  "LANGUAGE OF",
                  "ABBREVIATED SOURCE",
                  "DOCUMENT TYPE",
                  "PUBLICATION STAGE",
                  "DOI",
                  "ABSTRACT",
                  "SOURCE",
                  "OPEN ACCESS",
                  "https:",
                  "CORRESPONDENCE ADDRESS",
                  "FUNDING ",
                  "INDEX KEYWORDS")

delete <- which(str_detect(scopus$Scopus, pattern = paste0(remove_lines, collapse = "|")))
scopus <- scopus[-delete]
```

### 3.1.2 identifying the relevant information to put them in a data frame

This data frame will be the list of our scopus articles for the four
missing years.

#### 3.1.2.1 Identifying ids

``` r
scopus$id <- str_detect(scopus$Scopus, pattern = "^[:digit:]{8,}")
```

#### 3.1.2.2 Identifying authors

``` r
name <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) - 1 # this saves the position in the text of authors names (one line above the id)

scopus$author <- FALSE # useful later for affiliations
scopus[name]$author <- TRUE
```

#### 3.1.2.3 identifying title

``` r
titre <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) + 1
```

#### 3.1.2.4 Identifying informations on the article (journal, volume, etc.)

``` r
info <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) + 2
```

#### 3.1.2.5 Identifying authors’s affiliations

The problem here is that some affiliations are on two lines when you
have several authors or when one author has several affiliations. N.B.:
in the case of several authors, we are unable to know which affiliation
is corresponding to each author.

``` r
scopus$start_ref <- str_detect(scopus$Scopus, pattern = "REFERENCES:") # identifying the first line of the references. We will also need this later
scopus$affiliation <- str_detect(scopus$Scopus, pattern = "AFFILIATIONS:") # finding the line of affiliation
aff <- which(scopus$affiliation == TRUE) + 1 # taking the next line
scopus[aff][author != TRUE & start_ref != TRUE]$affiliation  <- TRUE
aff <- which(scopus$affiliation == TRUE) 
affiliation  <- scopus[aff]$Scopus # we take all the line with affiliations

# when affiliation is in two lines we merge the two lines (no better method find)
for(i in 1:length(affiliation)){
  if(!str_detect(affiliation[i], pattern = "AFFILIATIONS")){
    affiliation[i] <- paste0(affiliation[i-1],affiliation[i])
    affiliation[i-1] <- NA
  }
}
affiliation  <- as.data.table(affiliation)[!is.na(affiliation)]

# we put NA for articles without affiliations
affiliation <-  rbind(affiliation,
                  rep(NA,length(scopus[id == TRUE]$Scopus) - length(affiliation$affiliation)),
                  use.names = FALSE) # filling missing values with NA
```

#### 3.1.2.6 Creating the data frame of articles

``` r
scopus_art <- data.table("temp_id" = 1:length(scopus[id == TRUE]$Scopus),
           "id" = scopus[id == TRUE]$Scopus, 
           "author" = scopus[name]$Scopus, 
           "title" = scopus[titre]$Scopus,
           "info" = scopus[info]$Scopus,
           "affiliation" = affiliation)
```

### 3.1.3 Identifying references

This task is a bit harder as they are on several lines. What we do is to
associate each reference of an article to the `temp_id` of the article.

``` r
start_ref <- which(scopus$start_ref == TRUE)
end_ref <- which(scopus$id == TRUE) - 2 # identifying the last line of the references (two lines above the id)
end_ref <- c(end_ref[-1], length(scopus$Scopus)) # removing the first value which is logically 0 (for the first article) and adding the last line of the text which is the last reference of the last article
```

We delete each line which corresponds to an article without references.
Indeed, we have a `end_ref` value, but no `start_ref` as there is no
reference in this article. We also do it for the names, as it will be
needed later to match each set of references with their corresponding
article.

``` r
for(i in 1:1000){
  name <- name[-min(which(start_ref > end_ref))]
  end_ref <- end_ref[-min(which(start_ref > end_ref))]
  
  if(length((which(start_ref > end_ref))) == 0){
    break
  }
}
```

We create the data table which associates each `temp_id` of articles
with at least one reference, to the references they cite. That is a
direct citation data frame that we now need to clean.

``` r
scopus_ref  <- data.table("temp_id" = c(),
                          "references" = c())

for(i in 1:length(start_ref)){
ref_lines  <- start_ref[i]:end_ref[i]
ref_year <- data.table("temp_id" = scopus_art[author %in% scopus[name]$Scopus]$temp_id[i],
                       "references" = scopus[ref_lines]$Scopus)
scopus_ref  <- rbind(scopus_ref,ref_year)
}
```

We create the data table which associates each `temp_id` of articles
with at least one reference, to the references they cite. That is a
direct citation data frame that we now need to clean.

``` r
scopus_ref  <- data.table("temp_id" = c(),
                          "references" = c())

for(i in 1:length(start_ref)){
  ref_lines  <- start_ref[i]:end_ref[i]
  ref_year <- data.table("temp_id" = scopus_art[author %in% scopus[name]$Scopus]$temp_id[i],
                         "references" = scopus[ref_lines]$Scopus)
  scopus_ref  <- rbind(scopus_ref,ref_year)
}
```

## 3.2 Cleaning the corpus

We first tackle the data table with the list of articles. WE need to
clean the id, giving names corresponding to the WoS format (SURNAME-F),
creating as many lines as author, cleaning journal and volume info, as
well as affiliations.

### 3.2.1 Cleaning `id`

We only keep the first id, before the first semicolon

``` r
scopus_art  <- scopus_art[, id:= str_replace(id, pattern = ";.*", "")]
```

### 3.2.2 Cleaning `author`

We need to separate surnames and initials for each authors.

The first step is to calculate the maximum number of authors for an
article. We use the number of comma in a row to calculate this (one
comma, separating surname and initial means 1 author, 3 commas mean 2
authors, etc.). Then we can create the different columns to put the
surnames and initials in.

``` r
nb_authors <- max((str_count(scopus_art$author, ",") + 1)/2)
name_column <- paste0(c("surname_","initial_"),rep(1:nb_authors, each = 2))

scopus_art  <- scopus_art %>% 
separate(author, name_column, ",")
```

We want to avoid NA initials and we want to clean this as soon as
possible, thus we check if we have missing values

``` r
test  <-  scopus_art %>% 
  filter(!is.na(surname_1) & is.na(initial_1)) %>% 
  select(surname_1)
if(length(test$surname_1) > 0){
  message("Missing values for initials")
} else {
    message("No missing values for initials")
  }

scopus_art %>% 
  filter(!is.na(surname_2) & is.na(initial_2)) %>% 
  select(surname_2)
if(length(test$surname_2) > 0){
  message("Missing values for initials")
} else {
  message("No missing values for initials")
}
```

we now want to create authors column like in WoS

``` r
# cleaning by removing space, punctuation, and fusioning surnames and initials
scopus_art %<>% 
  mutate(across(contains("surname"), ~ remove_space(.x, replacement = "-")),
         across(contains("initial"), ~ remove_punct(remove_space(.x))),
         across(contains("surname"), ~ str_replace(.x,"^-",""))) %>% 
  .[, `:=` (author_1 = paste0(surname_1,"-",initial_1),
            author_2 = paste0(surname_2,"-",initial_2),
            author_3 = paste0(surname_3,"-",initial_3),
            author_4 = paste0(surname_4,"-",initial_4),
            author_5 = paste0(surname_5,"-",initial_5))] %>% 
  .[, -..name_column]
```

we now wants to have all the authors in one column.

``` r
scopus_art %<>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("author"), 
               names_to = c("order"), 
               values_to = "author")  %>% 
  filter(author != "NA-NA") %>% 
  mutate(order = str_extract(order, "[:digit:]")) %>% # just keeping the number in order, giving us the order of authors in the paper (as in WoS)
  as.data.table()
```

we save the list of authors per article in a separate dataframe. In the
main dataframe, we will only keep the rows with the first author. We
also keep the affiliations in a separated dataframe

``` r
saveRDS(scopus_art[,c("temp_id","author","order")], paste0(eer_data,"scopus_authors.RDS"))

scopus_inst <- scopus_art[order == 1][,c("temp_id","affiliation.affiliation")]
scopus_art <- scopus_art[order == 1][, -c("id","order","affiliation.affiliation")]
```

### 3.2.3 Cleaning `scopus_art`

We need to put the year, the Review (which is the same in our case), the
volume, the number, and the pages in separated columns, and delete the
number of citations.

``` r
scopus_art[, `:=` (title = toupper(title), # useful for later
                   Annee_Bibliographique = extract_year(info),
                   Journal = "European Economic Review",
                   info = str_remove(str_remove(info, ".*Review, "), ". Cited .*"))] %>% 
  .[, `:=` (Volume = str_extract(info, "^."),
            Number = str_extract(info, "([:digit:]{1})"),
            Pages = str_remove(str_remove(str_extract(info, "pp.*"), "pp. "), "\\."))] # We first extract the number following pp., then we remove pp. and the final point.
```

The `scopus_art` is now clean, and we can save it \!

``` r
saveRDS(scopus_art[,-"info"], paste0(eer_data,"scopus_articles.RDS"))
```

### 3.2.4 Cleaning `affiliation` (`scopus_inst`)

We first have to separate the rows where there are two affiliations, and
put them in a “long” format.

``` r
affiliation_column <- paste0("affiliation_",1:(max(str_count(scopus_inst$affiliation.affiliation,";"), na.rm = TRUE) + 1))

scopus_inst %<>% 
  rename("affiliation" = affiliation.affiliation) %>% 
  mutate(affiliation = str_remove(affiliation, "AFFILIATIONS: ")) %>% 
  separate(affiliation, all_of(affiliation_column), ";") %>% 
  pivot_longer(all_of(affiliation_column), names_to = "order_inst", values_to = "affiliation") %>% 
  mutate(order_inst = str_remove(order_inst, "affiliation_")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(affiliation))
```

We can now clean the affiliations:

  - we first extract the last part, which is in general the country
  - we clean the country by hand
  - we split the remaining part, the first one being the institution,
    the second one the city.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  mutate(country = str_extract(affiliation, ",[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ-'\\- ]{1,}$") %>% 
           str_remove(",|, ") %>% 
           str_trim("both")) %>% 
  mutate(country = replace(country, country == "Beograd", "Yoguslavia")) # hand cleaning
```

To take into account of missing countries, we delete the last part of
affiliation for affiliations that contain the name of an identified
country

``` r
countries <- unique(scopus_inst$country)

scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  mutate(affiliation = str_remove(affiliation, paste0(countries,collapse = "|")) %>% 
           str_trim("right") %>% 
           str_remove(",$")) 
```

We can now tackle the remaining part of the affiliation. We count the
number of commas before to split `affiliation`, in order to create the
needed number of columns and then to name properly the column (it should
be `institution`,`city`,`state`, the latter being only for the US).

``` r
affiliation_column <- paste0("affiliation_",1:(max(str_count(scopus_inst$affiliation,","), na.rm = TRUE) + 1))

scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  separate(affiliation, all_of(affiliation_column), ",") %>% 
  mutate(across(contains("affiliation"), ~ str_trim(.x, "both"))) 
```

We identify states and cities:

``` r
scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  mutate(city = !str_detect(affiliation_2, " |\\."), # string without space or point are cities
         state = str_extract(affiliation_3, "[A-Z]{2}")) %>% # two upper letters string are US states
  as.data.table()
```

We build the list of cities and remove them from `affiliation_2`:

``` r
cities <- scopus_inst[city == TRUE | affiliation_2 == "The Hague", 
                      c("temp_id","order_inst","affiliation_2")] # We build the list of cities, adding "The Hague" we did not fit in the criteria above (no space, no point)
setnames(cities,"affiliation_2","city")
scopus_inst <- merge(scopus_inst[,-c("city")], 
                     cities, by = c("temp_id","order_inst"), all.x = TRUE) 
scopus_inst[affiliation_2 == city]$affiliation_2 <- NA # we remove affiliation_2 values that are cities
```

We are doing the same for states and `affiliation_3`

``` r
states <- unique(scopus_inst$state)
scopus_inst[str_detect(affiliation_3,paste0(c(states,"Netherlands"), collapse ="|"))]$affiliation_3 <- NA # removing already identified values
```

We add the only value of affiliation\_4 which is a state

``` r
scopus_inst[!is.na(affiliation_4)]$state <- scopus_inst[!is.na(affiliation_4)]$affiliation_4 
```

We now tackle the corrections of small problems and errors:

``` r
scopus_inst[affiliation_1 == "Central Planning Bureau"]$country <- "Netherlands"
scopus_inst[affiliation_3 == "Washington"]$city <- scopus_inst[affiliation_3 == "Washington"]$affiliation_3  

add_ref <- data.table(temp_id = c(scopus_inst[affiliation_2 == "Ecole des Hautes Etudes"]$temp_id,
                                  scopus_inst[affiliation_3 == "and Université Libre de Bruxelles"]$temp_id),
                      order_inst = c(2,2),
                      affiliation_1 = c("EHESS","Université Libre de Bruxelles"),
                      city = c("Paris","Brussels"),
                      country = c("France","Belgium"))

scopus_inst[affiliation_1 == "University of Geneva"]$affiliation_2 <- NA
scopus_inst[affiliation_1 == "University of Geneva"]$affiliation_3 <- NA
scopus_inst[affiliation_1 == "University of Geneva"]$city <- "Geneva"
scopus_inst[affiliation_3 == "and Université Libre de Bruxelles"]$affiliation_3  <- NA

scopus_inst <- rbind(scopus_inst, add_ref, fill = TRUE)

scopus_inst[str_detect(affiliation_1, "CORE")]$city <- "Louvain"
```

We now remove the two useless columns (3 and 4) and merge the two
remaining ones (1 and 2)

``` r
scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>% 
  select(-c(affiliation_3, affiliation_4)) %>% 
  unite("institution",affiliation_1:affiliation_2, sep = ", ") %>% 
  mutate(institution = str_remove(institution, ", NA"))
```

We add the missing cities when they are in the list of cities we already
have plus those we can identify by looking at `institution`:

``` r
cities <- c(unique(scopus_inst[!is.na(city)]$city),
            "Leyden",
            "Tel-Aviv",
            "Piraeus",
            "Montréal",
            "Bowling Green",
            "Budapest",
            "Lund",
            "Naples",
            "Yale",
            "Cambridge")
scopus_inst <- scopus_inst %>%
  mutate(city_sup = str_extract(institution, paste0(cities, collapse = "|"))) %>% 
  as.data.table()
scopus_inst[is.na(city)]$city <- scopus_inst[is.na(city)]$city_sup
```

If we have the city of an institution, we use this city for replacing NA
value in `city` for the same institutions:

``` r
known_city <- scopus_inst[str_detect(institution,paste0(scopus_inst[is.na(city)]$institution, collapse = "|")), c("institution","city")][!is.na(city)]
for(i in seq_along(known_city$city)){
scopus_inst[institution == known_city$institution[i]]$city <- known_city$city[i]
}
```

We can now save the affiliations data

``` r
saveRDS(scopus_inst[,-"city_sup"], paste0(eer_data,"scopus_institutions.RDS"))
```

## 3.3 Cleaning the references

We now tackle the direct citation data frame. We need to extract the
different information in each references \#\#\# Removing the term
“REFERENCES”

``` r
scopus_ref[, references:= str_remove(references, "REFERENCES: ")]
```

### 3.3.1 Dealing with several references on line and cleaning

First problem, we sometimes have two references on one line. One way to
detect this is to spot the lines where the semi-colon is followed by at
least one character. We thus need to split these lines in two and
retransforme the table in a long format.

``` r
# just to check, detecting if there are two reference on one line
if(length(which(str_detect(scopus_ref$references, ";."))) > 0){
  message("There are lines with two references. Need for splitting.")
}

scopus_ref %<>% 
  separate(references, c("references","ref2"), ";") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("references","ref2"),
               names_to = "order",
               values_to = "references") %>% 
  select(-order) %>% 
  filter(references != "" & !is.na(references))
```

We can now give an idea to each reference

``` r
setDT(scopus_ref)[, temp_idref := 1:.N]
```

We can clean the references by removing first and last space

``` r
scopus_ref[, references := str_trim(references, "both")]
```

A first additional cleaning we can do is to remove the references
beginning by a year between brackets. In each case either it is a very
particular reference (a European report for instance) or it is the
reference where one reference (the one in the line above) has been
reprinted. That is not perfect to remove that but we don’t need this
information and it will simplify our data and our work.

``` r
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[!str_detect(scopus_ref$references, "^\\([:digit:]{4}\\)")]
```

Lastly, we correct some things that will cause problems later.

``` r
scopus_ref[, references := str_replace(references, "Kronsjo¨","Kronsjo")]
scopus_ref[, references := str_remove(references, "et al.,")]
```

### 3.3.2 Determining the type of references

We need first to know if a reference is an article (title is before
year), or if it is a book or report or similar.

``` r
scopus_ref[, article := str_detect(references, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ-'\\- ]{1,}, [a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ-]{1,}")]
```

Article also included chapters of books. Thus, the title will be the
title of the chapter and the `Journal` will be the title of the book.
Other info on the book will be in `journal_info` (see below). \#\#\#
Extracting the Year

That is the simplest task as we just need to extract the numbers between
brackets. We will keep it in `references` as it will help us to identify
the title.

We will delete the references without a year. Either they are references
to unpublished conference paper, or to not yet published article, or
they are the second line in a reference, which designate where the work
(in the line above) has been reprinted. That’s a simplification that we
can abandon later, but for now, we delete reference with no value as a
`Year`.

``` r
scopus_ref[, Year := extract_year(references)]
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[!is.na(Year)]
```

### 3.3.3 Dealing with articles

For articles, we have the name of the authors, sometimes the first name,
and the title of the article before the year between brackets. First, we
will extract the information before the bracket to put it in a separate
column. We extract the year between brackets to be sure that we don’t
extract the text before a bracket in the title, and then remove the year
and the bracket.

``` r
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, 
           article_info := str_remove(str_extract(references, ".*\\([:digit:]{4}\\)"),
                                      "\\([:digit:]{4}\\)")]
```

The second step is to try to identify when you have the first name of an
author, or several authors.

``` r
# Extracting first author and removing it from article_info
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, `:=` (author_1 = str_remove(str_extract(article_info, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ-'\\- ]{2,},"), ","), # we need special characters and space (for two parts name)
                                  article_info = str_remove(article_info, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ-]{2,},"))]

# Then we count the number of commas on the remaining article info
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, comma_count := str_count(article_info, ",")]

# if 0 comma, it means we have the title of article
article_title <- scopus_ref[article == TRUE & comma_count == 0, c("temp_idref","article_info")] 
setnames(article_title, "article_info", "article_title")
scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, article_title, by = "temp_idref", all.x = TRUE)
```

We can now split every article info with at least one comma. We create
the number of columns corresponding to the number of splits (3 commas
mean 4 splits). Then, we create a new object with the splitted
information, in order to identify if each splits is an author or a part
of the title.

``` r
info_title <- paste0("article_info_", 1:(max(scopus_ref$comma_count, na.rm = TRUE)+1)) 

working_title <- scopus_ref %>% 
  filter(comma_count > 0 & article == TRUE) %>% 
  separate(article_info, all_of(info_title), ",") %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = info_title, ~str_trim(.x, side = "both"))) %>% # removing first and last whitespace if any
  select(temp_idref, info_title, comma_count) 

working_title <- working_title %>% 
  mutate(across(.cols = info_title, ~str_length(.x), .names = "{col}_length"))

working_title[!str_detect(article_info_1, " ") &
              !article_info_1 %in% c("Dimension","Industry-wide","Qualities") |  # need a bit of manual cleaning
               article_info_1 %in% c("de la Vallée Poussin","De Leeuw","de Wolff","de la Vinelle","van Praag"),  
              second_author := TRUE]
```

We can merge second author with the main table. When it is not second
author, it means it is part of the title (it cannot be the title as
there was at least one comma, so something is following), and we should
merge it with the following columns. As we want to avoid merging the
name of the second author, we should replace it by an empty string.

``` r
scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, 
                    working_title[second_author == TRUE, c("temp_idref","article_info_1")], 
                    by = "temp_idref", 
                    all.x = TRUE)
setnames(scopus_ref,"article_info_1","author_2")

working_title[second_author == TRUE]$article_info_1 <- "" 
working_title <- working_title %>% 
  unite("article_info_12",article_info_1:article_info_2, sep=" ") %>% 
  mutate(article_info_12_length = str_length(article_info_12)) %>%  # to repeat the same process
  mutate(article_info_12 = str_trim(article_info_12, side = "left"))
```

Before to repeat the same process, we can see that some raws for the new
column created are empty. In other words, there is nothing after the
second author. After checking, it appears that it is books with two
authors. We can thus set their `article` value as “FALSE”. For these
references, we also create a new column to remind us that we have
already identified the two authors.

``` r
scopus_ref[temp_idref %in% working_title[article_info_12 == ""]$temp_idref, book_multi_authors := TRUE] 
scopus_ref[book_multi_authors == TRUE]$article <- FALSE 
```

We remove these books from the `working_title` dt.

``` r
working_title <- working_title[article_info_12 != ""]
```

we can now repeat the same process as above but with the new united
column

``` r
working_title[!str_detect(article_info_12, " ") &
              !article_info_12 %in% c("Uncertainty","Profits") &
              article_info_12_length < 15  |  # need a bit of manual cleaning
              article_info_12 == "de la ValleéPoussin ",
              third_author := TRUE]
```

We repeat the merging

``` r
scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, 
                    working_title[third_author == TRUE, c("temp_idref","article_info_12")], 
                    by = "temp_idref", 
                    all.x = TRUE)
setnames(scopus_ref,"article_info_12","author_3")

working_title[third_author == TRUE]$article_info_12 <- "" 
working_title <- working_title %>% 
  unite("article_info_123",article_info_12:article_info_3, sep=" ") %>% 
  mutate(article_info_123_length = str_length(article_info_123)) %>%  # to repeat the same process
  mutate(article_info_123 = str_trim(article_info_123, side = "left"))
```

We search again for books, now with 3 authors:

``` r
scopus_ref[temp_idref %in% working_title[article_info_123 == ""]$temp_idref, book_multi_authors := TRUE] 
scopus_ref[book_multi_authors == TRUE]$article <- FALSE 
```

We remove these books from the `working_title` dt.

``` r
working_title <- working_title[article_info_123 != ""]
```

We repeat a last time the process to identify a fourth author

``` r
working_title[!str_detect(article_info_123, " "),
              fourth_author := TRUE]
```

We repeat the merging

``` r
scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, 
                    working_title[fourth_author == TRUE, c("temp_idref","article_info_123")], 
                    by = "temp_idref", 
                    all.x = TRUE)
setnames(scopus_ref,"article_info_123","author_4")

working_title[fourth_author == TRUE]$article_info_123 <- "" 
working_title <- working_title %>% 
  unite("article_info_1234", article_info_123:article_info_4, sep=" ") %>% 
  mutate(article_info_1234 = str_trim(article_info_1234, side = "left"))
```

We search again for books, now with 4 authors:

``` r
scopus_ref[temp_idref %in% working_title[article_info_1234 == ""]$temp_idref, book_multi_authors := TRUE] 
scopus_ref[book_multi_authors == TRUE]$article <- FALSE 
```

We remove these books from the `working_title` dt.

``` r
working_title <- working_title[article_info_1234 != ""]
```

We can now clean the title by removing the NA and merge them as titles
in the main dt.

``` r
working_title[, article_title_2 := str_remove(str_remove(article_info_1234, " NA$"), " NA$")] %>% 
  .[, article_title_2 := toupper(article_title_2)]

scopus_ref <- merge(scopus_ref, 
                    working_title[,c("temp_idref","article_title_2")], 
                    by = "temp_idref", 
                    all.x = TRUE)
scopus_ref[is.na(article_title) & 
             !is.na(article_title_2)]$article_title <- scopus_ref[is.na(article_title) & 
                                                                    !is.na(article_title_2)]$article_title_2
```

We still need to identify the journal, volume, numero, pages, etc… But
we will do that later, as it will be easier as soos as we have finished
the work for books. \#\#\# Dealing with books

We already have identified the authors of books when there are several
authors. We just need to identify the authors when there is only one.

``` r
scopus_ref[article == FALSE & 
           is.na(book_multi_authors),
           author_1 := str_extract(references, "^.*\\([:digit:]{4}\\)") %>% 
             str_remove(" \\([:digit:]{4}\\)") %>% 
             str_remove_all(",")]
```

We now need to identify the titles of the book. We will extract all the
information after the year between brackets, what will also be of used
for identifying publication information of articles later (journal,
volume, etc.)

``` r
scopus_ref[, remaining_info := str_trim(str_remove(references, ".*\\([:digit:]{4}\\)"), "both")]
scopus_ref[article == FALSE, book_title := remaining_info]

scopus_ref[, book_title := str_trim(book_title, "both") %>% 
             str_remove_all(" ,")] %>% 
  .[, `:=` (book_info = str_remove(book_title, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ0-9':\\.\\-? ]{2,},"),
            book_title = str_remove(str_extract(book_title, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ0-9':\\.\\-? ]{2,},"),","))]
```

### 3.3.4 Back on articles: extracting Journal and other infos

We first need to extract the journal, that is the information before the
comma. When there is no comma in the string, it means that’s the name of
the journal.

``` r
scopus_ref[article == TRUE, comma_count := str_count(remaining_info, ",")] %>% 
  .[comma_count == 0, journal := remaining_info] %>% 
  .[comma_count > 0, `:=` (journal = str_remove(str_extract(remaining_info, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ:' ]{2,},"), ","),
                           journal_info = str_trim(str_remove(remaining_info, "^[a-zA-ZÀ-ÿ:' ]{2,},"), "both"))] %>% 
  .[!is.na(journal_info), `:=` (volume = str_extract(journal_info, "^[0-9]{1,3}"),
                                numero = str_remove_all(str_extract(journal_info, "\\([0-9]{1,3}\\)"), "[\\(\\)]"),
                                pages = str_remove_all(str_extract(journal_info, "p. [0-9].*"),"^p. |., .*| ff"))]
```

### 3.3.5 Passing in long format because of multiple authors

We will delete useless column, and pass the multiple authors in rows,
meaning that a reference will have as many lines as its number of
authors.

``` r
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[,-c("article_info",
                             "comma_count",
                             "book_multi_authors",
                             "article_title_2",
                             "remaining_info",
                             "book_info",
                             "journal_info")]
```

We merge the title column

``` r
scopus_ref[, title := article_title]
scopus_ref[!is.na(book_title)]$title <- scopus_ref[!is.na(book_title)]$book_title
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref[, -c("article_title","book_title")]
```

We now pass the table in long format with authors in rows and not in
columns

``` r
scopus_ref <- scopus_ref %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = contains("author"), names_to = "order", values_to = "author") %>% 
  mutate(order = str_remove(order, "author_")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(author) | order == 1) %>% # we want to avoid removing rows where we have no author (not the case here)
  select (temp_idref, temp_id, author, Year, title, journal, volume, numero, pages, order, article, references) %>% # We want to reorder a bit
  as.data.table()
```

### 3.3.6 Correcting errors

``` r
scopus_ref[author == "Belassa"]$author <- "Balassa"
```

### 3.3.7 saving the result

We save two versions:

  - One with all the authors (just in case)
  - One with just the first author, as we have in WoS.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
saveRDS(scopus_ref, paste0(eer_data,"scopus_references_extended.RDS"))
saveRDS(scopus_ref[order == 1], paste0(eer_data,"scopus_references.RDS"))
```
