#' # What is this script for?
#' 
#' This script aims at replicating the [1_building_dynamic_networks.md](/dynamic_networks/1_building_dynamic_networks.md) 
#' but for the EER. It uses the data extracted in [1_Script_EER_corpus.md](/EER_Paper/1_Script_EER_corpus.md) and 
#' it creates the networks of EER publications for different time windows. 
#' We want one-year moving time windows on the whole period (1969-2016) and we need functions automating the creation
#' of the different windows. This script creates the networks, finds communities, integrates the name 
#' of communities, calculates coordinates and saves the nodes and edges data in a long format.
#' 
#' 
#' > WARNING: This script still needs a lot of cleaning

#' # Creating the networks for each time windows
#' 
#' The first step is to build networks for different moving time window. You need to fix 
#' the length of the time window, and different criteria on the creation of edges.

#' We use the leiden_workflow function of the networkflow package (it uses the 
#' leidenAlg package). We set the number of iteration at 10000 to be sure but
