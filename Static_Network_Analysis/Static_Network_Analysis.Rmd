## Basic Statistics on communities

Follows a table summarizing major information about the communities of the bibliographic coupling network.  

To see how communities are positionned on the graph below, just look at the label of the most cited nodes in the table, and spot it on the graph.  

*Commentary 1:* Community 01 is a bit weird. It seems to aggregate kind of New-Keynesian stuff on credit cycle, monetary policy channel of transmission, citing Bernanke and Friedman 63, with post-keynesian stuff, citing Keynes, with author like LR Wray. Perhaps that's the post-keynesian that are citing a lot the New-Keynesian/Bernanke stuff. But perhaps it would also disappear with a different Leiden resolution, or with CMP. Community 01 has also an interesting structure: the most cited nodes (Bernanke, Kiyotaki, etc.), which are New-Keynesian references, are central in the graph, whereas the rest of the community is peripheral, south of the graph. It strengthens the idea of something weird with this community. 

*Commentary 2:* Problem similar with community 06: the bigger node is Clarida 1999, which is a standard reference in New Keynesian Macro. But you have the bigger part of the community which is peripheral, north of the graph. Most of the work seems to be on the term structure of interest rates. Part are published in Finance journals, other in econometric or monetary macro journals (Management represents 33% of the nodes). Perhaps we should check in the peripheral nodes are not thus published in finance journal, and the more central in monetary macro journals, strengthening the idea of a strong division between macro and finance people (even when they are dealing with a similar topic, aka term structure).
