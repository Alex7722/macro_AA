## What will you find in this directory?

Here are all the scripts gathering the different functions used in the
project. Many constitutes a first step to be later implemented in
[biblionetwork](https://agoutsmedt.github.io/biblionetwork/index.html)
and [networkflow](https://github.com/agoutsmedt/networkflow) packages.

This directory contains:

### Functions\_for\_corpus

[Functions\_for\_corpus](/functions/Functions_for_corpus.R) will list
all the functions used for creating the corpus. Empty for now.

### functions\_for\_network\_analysis

[functions\_for\_network\_analysis](/functions/Functions_for_network_analysis.md)
list all the functions used for creating different networks, analyse
them and display them.

### functions\_for\_cleaning\_strings

[functions\_for\_cleaning\_strings](/functions/functions_for_cleaning_strings.md)
list all the functions used for cleaning text strings quicker.
